# SCheMeRogueLike

This is my personal attempt to realize a roguelike with Chicken Scheme.
The game is not playable yet.


## Dependencies

* [Chicken](https://call-cc.org/) Scheme 5
* The library ncurses


## Building and installation
You can install entering the following with root permissions:

`make install`

Then you can play giving the command `scmrl`
If you only want to build the game (root permissions aren't required) without installing:

`make build`

The game executable will be compiled in this directory, then you can play with:

`./scmrl`
